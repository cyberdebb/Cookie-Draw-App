# Cookies Draw App

Cookie Draw App is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to perform cookie-based draws in a simple and interactive way. The application combines a modern web interface with backend services to manage draws, users, and notifications.

---

## Overview

The system is composed of a **PWA frontend** with **push notification support**, allowing users to receive real-time updates about draws, and a **Node.js backend built with Express**, which exposes a **RESTful API** for managing application logic and data persistence.

All data is stored in a **MongoDB database**, ensuring reliable storage of draw results and application information. The architecture follows a clear separation between frontend and backend, making the project scalable and easy to maintain.

## Vite

There is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) bundler setup. It compiles and bundles all "front-end" resources. You should work only with files located in `/src` folder. Vite config located in `vite.config.js`.

## PWA

This is a PWA. Don't forget to check what is inside of your `service-worker.js`. It is also recommended that you disable service worker (or enable "Update on reload") in browser dev tools during development.
## Assets

Assets (icons, splash screens) source images located in `assets-src` folder. To generate your own icons and splash screen images, you will need to replace all assets in this directory with your own images (pay attention to image size and format), and run the following command in the project directory:

```
framework7 assets
```

Or launch UI where you will be able to change icons and splash screens:

```
framework7 assets --ui
```
